Welcome Saturday! Start up the day with a little mismatch in communication between me and Nam Tran (the Professor). I’m having a show off and arrogant attitude right now, “need less of this please” - said myself. Other than that, everything is still going smoothly for MediHub.

Back home and wait for my parents to have lunch.

I took a defect lunch box back to warranty, they will reply to me on next week monday.

Then it come.. the heavy rain, broke my ill will to running. So I pick up chest & abs and leg exercises instead.

Listening to mad max ost at late night and pounding down this date journal, it’s getting late now - about 30 minutes from my expected bed time. So time to wrap it up!

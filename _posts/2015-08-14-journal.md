Today is a great start with forming up new team R&D Lab follow by a dull workflow with user API for MediHub, so 1 point deduction for productivity.

Finding way to keep R&D Lab entertain yet active for long period. For now the format of operating is research & learning anything for 1 quarter and then wrap up to conclusion, meaning we either switch to development phase or change to another topic and conclude the good & bad things about the topic.

First topic is Ruby on Rails, I hope everyone is getting pump up for things to come.

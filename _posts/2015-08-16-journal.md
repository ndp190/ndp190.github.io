Morning run would have ruin by me if not for my mother encourage (best Ma ever). Next up is reading time, if you have time and want to take a glance of economy subject, please do check out *Economics in one lesson* by *Henry Hazlitt*. I’m just read a few pages of it but I can assure you this is one oldie but goldie stuff.

Settings up some template for jekyll and push the blog to github.io. It’s incredibly easy to get the blog online with jekyll & github.io, actually I don’t think it’s gonna be that easy, just create a repository with one push and there ya go.

Exercise chest & abs, it’s 2 consecutive days for me - hooray. Gonna check out coursera network class but watching *Song of the sea* instead.

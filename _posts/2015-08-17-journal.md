Rise and shine, another day at office. I’m strolling through user API code again, make some tweak, add a voter to decide user has access right to user (yeah I know it sounds confuse).

After that I’m going to Bim’s house to teach him (& me) some more css and a little js, jquery.

Night time is fixing computer time, heck, I had once like this job but now it’s just plain annoyance.

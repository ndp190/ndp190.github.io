Super unproductive day today, mostly because of my over excited about the external drive which I bought at a very good price, and this is the first time I order something online too. My first time using tiki and first impression is very good.

Stay at office until seventh to play with my new bought toy. Come home at watch Usain Bolt did it again, it's still a long way to go for Gatlin to beat him.

Try out TV series and got sucked in Mr. Robot.

User API user API user API all the way!!

Go get the lunchbox after work, the box is still sticky because of my carelessness observation. I'm going to get it back tomorrow and demand a new one.

Went home exercise instead of running. Eat spaghetti, yummy - Thanks Mom!

Split and convert the journal from latex to markdown files. Latex was not the right tool to blog so I will get back to it another time. Revise journals.
